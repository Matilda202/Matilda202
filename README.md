## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ My name is **Matilda**, and I'm a Master's student at the **University of Turku**, specializing in **Medical Engineering and Health Technology** â€” so working with ECG data and signal analysis is part of my daily life!

ðŸ”¬ I'm currently working as a **research assistant** at the [Materials Informatics Laboratory](https://sites.utu.fi/mil/). My research focuses on **AI-assisted density-functional theory (DFT) simulations** to develop atomic-level insights into the **adsorption of biomolecules** on **carbon-based nanomaterials**. This knowledge supports the development of highly sensitive and selective electrochemical sensors.

ðŸš€ Right now, I'm:
- Writing my **masterâ€™s thesis** and diving deeper into [Bayesian Optimization Structure Search](https://sites.utu.fi/boss/)
- Applying what I've learned in lectures on **data analytics and visualization** to real-world research
- Deepening my skills in **Python**, **full-stack development**, and **data analysis**

ðŸ“Œ A few things about me:
- Passionate about **health tech**, **digital health**, and **human-centered design**
- Always open to **new challenges**
- Driven to **make a positive impact** through technology and collaboration
